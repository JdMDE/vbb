# This is the message configuration file in English for the menu and accelerator keys
# of the program vbb. Lines beginning with hash or which are empty will be ignored.
# This file has only two sections, MENU and SAVE, which must appear in precisely that order.
# The section's name must be written alone in a line, as long as each element of the section

# Section MENU contains the visible messages, in the order in which they must be shown. The
# order CANNOT be changed. Each menu item can have a single accelerator character which will
# be the one written inside (). All accelerators must be different, taking into account that
# they are taken as case-insensitive.
